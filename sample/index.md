# Sample Files

This folder contains anonymized example inputs that mirror the expected formats.

- `canvas_gradebook.csv`: Anonymized Canvas gradebook export with matching placeholder students and a small set of assignment columns.
- `override_grades.xlsx`: Example override file. Non-empty CC/CK/GK cells replace computed grades; `Reason` explains why.

All placeholder student names/IDs are consistent across the files above.
